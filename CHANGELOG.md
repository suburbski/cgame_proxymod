## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Add support for defrag versions 1.91.24, 1.91.25, 1.91.26 and 1.91.27.

### Changed
- Don't show the compass and the timer hud by default.
- Make compass, CampingGaz-HUD and Snap-HUD thinner by default.

## [1.3.1] - 2020-05-05
### Changed
- Only support defrag version 1.91.26.

## [1.3.0] - 2020-04-19
### Added
- Compass which is more accurate/flexible than `df_hud_cgaz`.
- New cvar `mdd_projection`. Determines how angles will be projected on the screen. This affects the compass, CampingGaz-HUD and Snap-HUD.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-04-13
### Added
- New command `mdd_help`. Provides information about cvars.

### Changed
- Invert meaning of `mdd_ammo`'s 2nd bit from the right.
- Extract the *trueness* bits from the `mdd_cgaz` cvar into `mdd_cgaz_trueness`.
- Rename `mdd_snap` cvar to `mdd_snap_trueness`.
- Rename `mdd_snap1` cvar to `mdd_snap`.
- Rename all `mdd_snap1_` cvars to `mdd_snap_`.

### Deprecated
- Wrong snapzones are shown when the *ground* bit is enabled in `mdd_snap_trueness`. Friction is not taken into account and will not happen in the near future.

### Removed
- Don't display second snaphud and remove all its `mdd_snap2` cvars.

## [1.1.3] - 2020-02-10
### Changed
- Draw all vanilla/defrag 2D hud elements (e.g. crosshair) on top of CampingGaz-HUD and Snap-HUD.

### Fixed
- Correctly display infinite ammo (i.e. -1).
- Draw fired grenade paths even after switching weapons.

## [1.1.2] - 2019-11-23
### Changed
- Rename `mdd_time` into `mdd_timer` to align more with the other commands of the timer hud.

## [1.1.1] - 2019-11-22
### Changed
- Don't bloat q3config.cfg and improve cross-platform config compatibility by only archiving cvars that have non-default values.

## [1.1.0] - 2019-11-22
### Added
- New cvar `mdd_fov`. When different from `0`, CampingGaz-HUD and Snap-HUD will use this fov instead of `cg_fov`.

### Removed
- Bounding box trigger display since engines support this now (`scr_triggers_draw 1` and `scr_clips_draw 1`).

## [1.0.0] - 2019-11-21
### Added
- Ammo and jump hud extended from [q3df](https://github.com/q3df/cgame_proxymod).

- Option to filter other player sounds extended from [krsh732](https://github.com/krsh732/cgame_proxymod).
- Initial CampingGaz-HUD which is more accurate/flexible than `df_hud_cgaz`.
- Initial Snap-HUD which is more accurate/flexible than `scr_hud_snap`.
